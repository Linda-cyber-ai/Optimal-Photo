# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Taking the best photo in crowded places and with the best light. Optimal photo in crowded tourist spots: AI can help to make up guide for visting different tourist spots during a holiday and make sure less other tourist are there at the same time if you want to take good pictures and avoid crowdes. This can also be combinated with weather casts and analysis of daylight. Background: The problem is that many spectacular toursit spots often are crowded, or have a bad light to take photo in. If you work with photo, are an influencer or just want to visit in a calm period, AI can solve this problem. Data and AI techniques: Data sources to use are visiting numbers during the year and during the day, togheter with weather forecast. How is it used: The solution is used by both travelers and proffesional photografers and influencers. Challenges: The project does not remove other tourist, so it might still be other people at the monument making it difficult to take a perfect photo. What next: It can be used for many known tourist spots/monument. “Building AI course project”
